# Wiredcraft Coding Test

Make sure you read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines in it.

## Background

Build a static version of the given mockup

## Getting started

There's nothing here, we leave it to you to choose the build tool, code structure, framework, testing approach...

## Requirements

- A single page application

- User can navigate from different screen

- Use a real map, either google maps or others

- Have clear documentation on how to run the code

- Provide unit tests for your JavaScript

## What We Care About


Feel free to use any libraries you would use if this were a real production app, but remember we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library.

We use `React.js` a lot together with `browserify` and some `ES6` code here in Wiredcraft.

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

Here's what you should aim for:

- Good use of current HTML, CSS, JS & performance best practices.

- Solid testing approach

- Extensible code;
